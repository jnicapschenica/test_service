# Testing System Administration App for RELEX

### About

React, React Router DOM, Typescript, CSS

Implemented User Authorisation with login: Administrator and password: 12345

Page Users shows users's test passing statistics

Page Tests shows list of existing tests and allows to delete and enable/disable them for users or create new test

Implemented logout

### Problems

Algorithms for working with tests are not fully implemented: adding new ones to the general list and deleting them are not added due to the complexity of working with existing data in files
